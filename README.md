#Mike Constantino's Portfolio

##About

This is my new portfolio as of April 2016. The revision directly before this was outdated in design. This site takes a much more modern design.

##Tech

This site is using **SASS, Node.JS, Gulp, BrowserSync, AutoPrefixer** and **always a mobile-first approach.**
